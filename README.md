# Stomata2TranspireNet 🌿💧

**Stomata2TranspireNet** is a deep learning-based pipeline to predict **leaf-level transpiration rates** from **microscopic images of stomata** and **environmental variables** like temperature, humidity, CO₂ concentration, and light intensity.

This project combines computer vision and tabular feature learning to bridge plant physiology with modern AI for better understanding and modeling of plant-water interactions.

## 🚀 Features

- 📷 **Stomatal Image Processing**: Preprocessing and augmentation of stomatal micrographs.
- 🌍 **Environmental Data Integration**: Incorporates key climate variables that influence transpiration.
- 🤖 **Multi-Modal Deep Learning**: Fusion of CNN and tabular input features for accurate prediction.
- 📊 **Evaluation Metrics**: Custom loss functions and metrics suited for regression on physiological data.
- 📁 **Modular Codebase**: Clean structure for experimentation and extension.
