class CNNLSTMRegressor(nn.Module):
    """
    A PyTorch model that combines a CNN (ResNet18) for image feature extraction and 
    an LSTM for weather time series encoding, to predict two continuous values (e.g., gsw and gbw).

    Architecture:
    - CNN Backbone (ResNet18): Extracts spatial features from input image.
    - LSTM: Encodes sequential weather data (e.g., temperature, humidity over time).
    - Fully Connected Head: Merges both representations and outputs two regression values.

    Args:
        weather_input_size (int): Number of features in each time step of the weather sequence.
        lstm_hidden_size (int): Number of hidden units in the LSTM.

    Inputs:
        image (Tensor): Input image tensor of shape (B, 3, H, W), where B is batch size.
        weather_seq (Tensor): Weather time series tensor of shape (B, T, F),
                              where T is sequence length and F is number of features.

    Returns:
        Tensor: A tensor of shape (B, 2) containing two predicted values per sample.
